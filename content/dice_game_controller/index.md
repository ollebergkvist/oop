# Dice Game 100

Welcome to the dice game 100!

In this game you will compete against the computer, where the first one to reach a score of a 100 wins!

## Round

A round starts by one of the players rolling their dices.

Dices with a value between 2-6 are valid values and are added to the total points for the current round.
A dice with the value two is worth two points, a dice with the value of three is worth tree points and so forth.

In case the player rolls a series of valid dices, the player can decide to save the current points or to continue the round by rolling another set
of dices in order to try and collect more points.

However if a player rolls a dice with the value of one the current round is cancelled and the turn goes to the other player. A losing player will also loose all points colleced from the current round.

Good luck!
